Panjim,"  Lying on the western coast, Goa is India's smallest state and unlike any other, known for its endless beaches, stellar nightlife, eclectic seafood, world-heritage listed architecture. Spread across just 3,702 km, Goa lies in the Konkan region. It is a far cry from the hippie haven or a beach getaway, and one of the only few destinations that is open 24x7. The laid-backness (susegad) of Goa attracts as many international tourists as it does Indians, or even more so. The Goans are quite friendly towards tourists and celebrate many festivals throughout the year, the most famous being the New Year and Goa Carnival. While the seafood is excellent, Goa has one of the best nightlife in India with trendy bars, beach shacks, elegant cafes and many clubs and discotheques. Thanks to lower alcohol prices in the state, Goa is also great for younger tourists with relatively tighter pockets.For those of us perpetually confused between North Goa and South Goa, this might help - the state of Goa is divided into North Goa and South Goa. While North Goa is the nightlife hub where all the touristy beaches, flea markets, and beach shacks are located, South Goa is the land of luxurious resorts and laid-back beach vibes. Having been a Portuguese territory for almost 450 years, the Portuguese architecture is nowhere as prevalent as in Goa - visit one of the many whitewashed churches, crumbling forts or spectacular churches. The yellow houses with purple doors, ochre coloured mansions and oyester shell windows is what completes the kalieodscope of Goan architecture. Panjim, the capital city located in the centre overlooks the calm Mandovi River where the famous floating casinos of Goa are docked. The centre is well-connected with an international airport and roads and trains run from North to South part of Goa. With a coastline stretching for over 100 kilometres, Goa has stunning beaches. While Baga and Calangute are more popular among the Indian family crowd, Anjuna and Arambol draw a lot of foreign tourists. The beaches in South Goa are relatively lesser explored, but some of them like Agonda and Palolem are more beautiful."," 1.

  "," Tirupati is crowded throughout the year; however, the best time to visit Tirupati is from September to February when the climate is relatively balmy with intermittent showers. The summers with its sweltering weather and humidity make Tirupati less ideal to visit. Winter months are ideal for sightseeing and also visiting the shrine, and the weather is pleasant. The town gets crowded by September which is the onset of Brahmotsavam, one of the auspicious festival of Tirupati. For temple hopping, the best season is again winter owing to festivals like Navratri and Dussehra falling in October. Avoid visiting Tirupati during April and May as the temperature is torrid and unbearable. ","Pai Viceroy

Hampi,"  Hampi, the city of ruins, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Situated in the shadowed depth of hills and valleys in the state of Karnataka, this place is a historical delight for travellers. Surrounded by 500 ancient monuments, beautiful temples, bustling street markets, bastions, treasury building and captivating remains of Vijayanagar Empire, Hampi is a backpacker's delight. Hampi is an open museum with 100+ locations to explore and a favourite way to see the city from the perspective of its history. Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagar empire around 1500 AD, and by some accounts, the second largest city in the world at that time. Over the next centuries it fell out of importance, and now you can explore the ruins of a lot of temples and other structures spread out over a vast area. The terrain around Hampi is as mysterious as the ruins itself - the city is surrounded by boulders of different sizes, and you can climb to the top of them with a little effort to get a stunning view of the entire city and the geography. It is located on the banks of the Tungabhadra River. Famous for its massive, beautifully carved temples, especially the Virupaksha Temple, dedicated to the patron deity of the empire. You can also find remains of the old aqueducts, canals and military barracks and stables here.

"," Jim Corbett National Park is well-connected to all major cities in India by trains and road. It is located in the Ramnagar city of Uttarakhand, 260 km from New Delhi, which makes it easily accessible. The most convenient way of reaching Corbett National Park is by road from Delhi, which takes around 6 hours. The nearest railway station to Corbett is in Ramnagar which is around 12 km away. It is connected by regular trains to all parts of India through New Delhi. Travelling to Corbett National Park by air is usually not preferred by tourists.  "," The best time to visit Jim Corbett National Park is between November and February i.e, during the winter season when all the zones are open, and you can spot the most animals. Another good time to visit Corbett is during summers which is the best time to spot most animals near water bodies. Monsoons (June- August) are likely not ideal since the park remains closed most of the time during these months.Jim Corbett National Park Opening Dates:All the five zones of Jim Corbett doesn't remain open at all times. The Jhirna Zone is open throughout the year, and you can find birds and occasionally tigers there as well. The Sitabani Zone is also open all year round. These zones have a drier area, with rocky plains that are easily navigable in the monsoon as well. The Dhikala Zone is the most coveted of them all, where you can find the highest number of tigers and cubs, but this zone is open only between 15 November and 15 June every year. Similarly, the Durga Devi Zone is also open only between November and June. The Bijrani Zone is open from October to June. This is because the three zones are hilly and have dense forests, which are at a higher risk for landslides. The roads to these zones are also blocked in the monsoon. Keep in mind that the Park closes at night, and you cannot camp inside the premises. ","The Den Corbett Resort

From the little houses spread around the area to the architecture of even the lamp posts, The Mall gives off a distinct colonial vibe.Another major highlight of Mussoorie is the Ropeway to Gun Hill. Gun Hill is the second highest peak in Mussoorie, and tourists can avail of the cable car ropeway ride to Gun Hill, which offers an enchanting view of the entire city as well as the surrounding Himalayan mountains.The adjoining little hill station of Landour, along with Mussoorie, Barlowganj and Jharipani together form the greater Mussoorie. Affording a mind-stirring view of the snow-dusted Himalayas, Mussoorie beckons trekkers, climbers and adventure sports enthusiasts."," 1.

Hyderabad,"  A city of contrasts, Hyderabad exudes an old-world charm of its own with the Old City (Charminar side), Hitech City (Cyberabad) and the other areas lying between the old and the new.

The Charminar stands in a labyrinth of lanes crammed with shops, markets, stalls and shoppers - one of the best places to shop for the authentic pearls and relish the tasty biryanis, skewer kebabs and haleem (the smorgasbord of food that Hyderabad is known for).  The other side of Hyderabad - HiTech City or Cyberabad - is a stark contrast to the Old City. The area teems with grand malls, pulsating clubs, sleek restaurants and hi-rise buildings of the every-growing multinationals.

Kaziranga National Park,"  Home to the largest population of the one-horned rhino on earth, Kaziranga National Park is one of India’s national treasures in terms of flora and fauna. Located in the state of Assam in North-Eastern India, its total area is shared by the districts of Nagaon, Golaghat and Karbi Anglong placing it roughly at the centre of the state. Approximately around five hours by road from Guwahati, Kaziranga National Park stands tall as the epitome of successful wildlife conservation in India. In 1985, it was awarded the status of a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Lying on the floodplains of the mighty river Brahmaputra, rich vegetation covers almost the entirety of Kaziranga National Park. Receiving massive amounts of rainfall each year, at times even crossing dangerous levels, this national park is characterised by tall elephant grass, marshlands and tall tropical broadleaf forests. Here, a wide variety of fauna thrives including the one-horned rhino, Asiatic elephants, wild water buffalo, leopards and Royal Bengal Tigers. Kaziranga National Park is also listed officially as a Tiger reserve and is home to one of the world’s largest population of tigers. Different types of birds can also be spotted here at the park. A popular migratory location for birds who fly down from the north, one can spot various birds such as the black-nested stork, the lesser white-fronted goose, ferruginous duck and Baer's pochard duck to name a few. Other notable bird families which can be seen here include the great Indian hornbill and wreathed hornbill among many others.Safaris can be undertaken both during the day and night during the open tourist season. Elephant rides are also very popular among tourists and wildlife journalists and enthusiasts. Hiking is one such activity which is prohibited here to avoid casualties. Great care is taken at this national park such that tourism and natural sustainability go hand in hand.",," Kaziranga is well-accessible by roads and has a lot of Airports and Railway stations nearby. The nearest Railway station being Furkating, from where Kaziranga is accessed in a matter of an hour. The nearest airport to Kaziranga is the Jorhat Airport, which is located at 97 km away from Kaziranga. The road networks here are well-developed and make transport easy to Kaziranga by road. 
  "," The best time to visit Kaziranga is anywhere from November to April. Since the whole of Assam receives a major rainfall in the monsoon and the pre-monsoon time of the year, the Kaziranga National Park floods in the months of June, July and August. No wonder the rhinos love bathing and staying in water during these months. The water starts receding in September and October and the place is open to tourism from November again.

Sabarimala,"  More than 30 million pilgrims visit the temple in Sabarimala annually, making it the largest in India and second largest in the world, after Hajj Pilgrimage of Mecca in Saudi Arabia. Located inside the Periyar Tiger Reserve, in the Pathanamthitta district of Kerala, Sabarimala is a temple town on the bank of the River Pampa. Named after the mythological character, Sabarimala shelters the famous Ayyapa temple. The temple is also known as Dharma Sashta and is believed to be the son of Shiva and Mohini, the feminine incarnation of Lord Vishnu. People believe that Vishnu's incarnate, Parasurama, placed the Ayyappa Idol at the top of the mountain. One can notice that the traditions of Sabarimala are a blend of Shaivism, Shaktism, Vaishnavism and other Sramana traditions. Women of age 12-50 years, during an active menstrual cycle, weren't allowed inside the temple until the supreme court overturned the restriction on 28th September 2018. The temple is situated amidst eighteen hills and dense forest surrounding the temple, which is known as Poongavanam. People trek up the mountains from Plapalli, proceeding to Aangaamuzhi, and then to Muzhiyaar and finally to Sabarigiri road. The temple is open on the first five days of each Malayalam month with it being most crowded during Mandalapooja, Makaravilakku or Makar Sankranti."," 1. Ayyappa Temple  :  The oldest historical account available about Sabarimala which at that time was known as Churulimala, can be found in the inscriptions of Xuanzang which reveal that the idol of the buddhist shrine was that of Avalokitesvara, who according to Buddhism, is an avatar of Bodhisattva. The word Dharmasasta is one of the eighteen synonyms of Gautama Buddha. The Mudra depicted by the idol of Ayyappa and the yogic position may have a connection to Vitarka mudra and Lotus position in which Buddha is depicted beautifully.  
 2. Makaravilakku  :  Makaravilakku is the festival celebrated every year in the month of January. The festival is celebrated on a remarable level in the Sabarimala temple, Kerala.

Various monolithic statues, Rathas, sculptured reliefs and miniatures can also be found.  
 20. Olakkannesvara Temple  :  Olakkannesvara Temple, also known as the Old Lighthouse, is a structural temple built in 8th century. The structure is made out of grey-white granite and has a shikar on the top. Owing to its location on a hillock, it provides a pleasing view of the town.

"," Mahabalipuram is very close to Chennai. So, it's best to proceed from Chennai via road. Buses arrive in the centre of the town from either Koyembedu (CMBT) or Tiruvanmiyur (in Chennai) and Kanchipuram. The drive from Chennai on the East Coast Road is, by Indian standards, a wonderful experience.  "," The best time to plan a trip to Mahabalipuram is when the winter season sets in, which is between October and March. The climate remains good with warm days and cold nights, ideal for outdoor activities and for exploring the town. The period from November to February is the peak tourism season when the climate is salubrious. Travelling to Mahabalipuram during summers are generally avoided because of the very high temperatures and the exhausting heat, which makes it difficult to travel around the town for sightseeing.

Bandipur National Park,"  Situated in  Karnataka, Bandipur National Park was once the hunting grounds of the Maharaja of Mysore. It was later established as a reserve in 1974 under Project Tiger and these deciduous forests rich in wildlife have become a popular tourist attraction since then. It is 80 km from Mysore enroute Ooty in Tamil Nadu. Due to a lot of wildlife casualties because of speeding vehicles that go through the park, a ban on traffic between 9 PM to 6 AM has been established to ensure the safety of the animals of the park. It is located in the Nilgiris and is the first Biosphere Reserve in India. Spread over 874 sq km, the park is replete with a wide range of endangered wildlife like elephants, hornbills, deers, pythons, sloth bears, pythons, panthers etc. and multitudes of teak and sandalwood trees. Bandipur National Park is neighbours with the Nagarhole and the Wayanad Wildlife sanctuaries and is a few minutes from the Mudumalai National Park. "," 1. Gopalaswamy Hills  :  Himavad Gopalaswamy Betta, is a hill, hence the name betta in Kannada, which located in the Chamarajanagar district of the state of Karnataka, at a height of 1450  metres. The hill is an  extensively wooded forest, and is also the highest peak in the Bandipur National Park. Lying in the core area of the Bandipur National Park, the hill is frequented by wild life, including mainly elephants, and is very famous for its Elephant Safari. Dense fog predominates the hill year around, the hill thus gets the prefix Himavad,  again in the native language of Kannada.  
 2. Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve  :  The Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve is an International Biosphere Reserve in the Western Ghats and Nilgiri Hill ranges of Southern India. The Western Ghats joining the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve comes under a  World Heritage Site as declared by UNESCO in 2012. It includes the Mudumalai, Mukurthi, Wayanad and Bandipur national parks.  The lovely ecosystem of the hill ranges of Nilgiris and its surrounding environments covering a tract of over 5000 square kilometers was constituted as Nilgiris Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in September 1986 under Man and Biosphere Programme. Nilgiris Biosphere Reserve is India's first and foremost biosphere reserves with a prime location, rich in both  flora and fauna.  
", Bandipur is well connected to other cities by road. Bus services are available from Bangalore and Mysore. The nearest airport is Coimbatore (84 km) and the nearest station is Mysore(80 km).  ," A haven for an infiinite variety of flora and fauna, Bandipur National Park is best visited during the winter season between October - March. The national park is enveloped in lush greenery where animals and birds add up to it's enchanting beauty. Bandipur can also be visited during the monsoon season between July and September where the park looks mesmerising. The rain enhances the beauty of the national park by making the whole place seemeven more greener. Summers are comparatively warmerespecially during the day when the sun shines brightly. However, it's the best time to spot animals and a plethora of colourful birds. ","The Serai Bandipur

 17. Anjar  :  Anjar is a town and municipality in Kutch District, Gujarat. With 1,400 years of history, it is known as the oldest town in Kutch. The desert climate in this region does not spare Anjar, sharing the same weather extremities. It has been a centre for trade and commerce in Kutch for eons, being a target of invasion in medieval times and during the British colonisation.  
", The only way to reach Kutch is by road as it's mostly desert. Kutch city does not have a dedicated railway station or airport. The nearest airport and railway station is in Bhuj. You will have to take a vehicle from here to reach Kutch.   ," Winters (November-Feb) are the best time to visit Kutch, mainly because of the full moon nights that turn the place into an absolute paradise. The Rann Festival is also organised at the same time. Summers should be avoided as temperatures can go as high as 45-degree Celcius. ","Royal Guest House

Tiruchirappalli,"  A treasure trove of ancient Dravidian temples, Tiruchirappalli is also known as Trichy, is one of the largest cities in Tamil Nadu. Commonly known as Trichy, it lies 320 kilometres away from the state capital of Chennai. Located on the banks of Cauvery River, this city is an effortless blend of old and new.The oldest living city of Tamil Nadu, Tiruchirappalli has a history dating back to the 3rd century BC. The historic site of Rockfort is the main highlight of this region. Packed with cave temples, it is the most beautiful example of temple architecture. Besides heritage tourism, Tiruchirappalli is an important educational hub that houses national level institutes. Vaikunta Ekadasi held in December is the most famous festival of this city. This auspicious celebration takes place in Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple, one of the largest temples in the world.For those who are looking for a shopping spree, Trichy has many local and upbeat markets where you can get almost everything. Textiles, cheap diamonds, and cigars are the best buys at these markets. An architectural delight, Tiruchirappalli must be on the bucket list of visitors interested in a historic encounter. "," 1. Sri Ranganatha Swamy Temple, Srirangam  :  This is a Hindu temple dedicated to Sri Ranganatha, a reclining form of the Hindu deity Maha Vishnu, situated in Srirangam. It is one of the most acclaimed temples of South India and has played a pivotal role in Vaishnavism history. It is located on an island between the Kaveri and Kollidam rivers. This has made it prone to flooding and plundering by armies like that of Delhi Sultanate. The temple was rebuilt in the 14th century and expanded in the 16th and 17th centuries with more gopurams (tower gateways).  
 2. Tiruchirappalli Rock Fort  :  If you are planning to delve yourself in the history of fierce battles, then Tiruchirappalli Rock Fort is an ideal place for you. It is a famous historical fortification and temple complex built on an ancient rock which is said to be 3.8 billion years old. This makes it the oldest formations in the world; also older than the Himalayas. The fort complex has witnessed many historic battles between the Madurai Nayakas and Adil Shah dynasty of Bijapur, Maratha Imperial Forces, and Carnatic region.  
"," Trichy is one of the most populated and largest cities in Tamil Nadu. Therefore, it is well connected with Tamil Nadu and the other major cities in the country by every primary means of transport.  "," Tiruchirapalli retains the same charisma throughout the year. However, December to March is the best time to visit Tiruchirapalli The weather during this time of the year is delightful with the temperature ranging from 20 to 32 degrees. Monsoons in Tiruchirapalli is all about heavy rainfall and humid weather; this is the least favourable season. Summers, on the other hand, lasts from March to May and witnesses hottest days.

Shivanasamudra Falls,"  Situated on the banks of river Kaveri, Shivanasamudra is primarily a hydropower project location but has gotten massive attention for its stunning waterfalls. Literally translating to 'Shiva's Sea', Shuvanasamudra is a picturesque town with rocky terrain and gushing waterfalls and is a popular tourist destination with Gaganachukki and Barachukki waterfalls being the ones you don't want to miss. Tourists enjoy the calm town amongst the roar of the cascading waters and the view from the vantage point. This calmness is infused with subtle hints of spirituality, given the Ranganatha temple here, which attracts pilgrims. The Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary is another important attraction here and is popular if you want to go fishing and trekking. There is parking available at the vantage point and a well-maintained place with many benches and steps which take you to many levels of vantage points. Since it's a waterfall, it is best to visit during monsoons as it'd be in its more glorious state. Beware of the monkeys at the vantage point as they tend to get a bit playful and sometimes will grab your belongings. So avoid wearing jewellery and keep your wallets in your pockets and bags. There is a scarcity of restaurants near the vantage point. You'd have to go to the town for that. ",," Shivanasamudra is only accessed by road. Shivanasamudra does not have a railway station or an airport, but the road connectivity is well maintained in all seasons. Many private taxis and buses regularly ferry tourists to and from this destination. The nearest airport is Bangalore International at 170 km away. The nearest railway station is the Mysore railway station at 77 km away.  "," September to January isthe best time to visit Shivanasamudra. Although the weather in this place remains agreeable throughout the year, the waterfalls are at their full glory during the monsoon season. Summers are not ideal to plan a trip to Shivanasamudra as the waterfall is scarce and its natural beauty isn't enchanting as the monsoons. Winters, on the other hand, is also an ideal time to plan a trip as the weather is pleasant and breezy, and the waterfalls are replete with cold water making the whole place look spellbinding.

"," This city is well connected by road and rail but does not have an airport. Being a major temple town, there are daily buses to surrounding cities like  Bangalore, Madurai, Salem, Chennai and Erode. Taxis and cars for hire are less common for intercity travel. Trains connecting this city to all the central stations nearby are also frequent, and the train station is just one kilometre away from the Nataraja temple.  "," Chidambram is located near the coast of the Bay of Bengal and so has a moderate climate throughout the year. Monsoon is not a distinct season, and there is some rainfall throughout the year. The maximum temperature is 33 degrees Celcius and the minimum ranges around 23 degrees Celcius. Winter is the best season to visit this city, but summers are also popular with tourists.

"," Almora, the summer capital of the Chand Kings of Kumaon, is best when visited during the spring-summer season, i.e. between March and May.

It is also a good time for outdoor and adventure activities like trekking and hiking. Almora sees a large number of trekkers joining adventure clubs and setting out on an exciting expedition through the scenic surroundings. The winter season (November to February) on the other hand is freezing and may not be everyone’s choice of a tourist destination, but off-beat travellers can make the most of the season. Monsoons, the time between July and September, mostly affect outdoor activities and are, therefore, not recommended to tourists who wish to explore Almora. ","Kasar Himalaya Holiday Home

Manikaran,"  Located at a distance of 4 km from Kasol along the banks of river Parvati in the Kullu District of Himachal Pradesh, Manikaran is known as a famous pilgrimage destination for both Sikhs and Hindus. A good number of temples, Gurudwara Manikaran Sahib and hot springs attract pilgrims and tourists alike. There are three hot springs where one can take a bath, one being inside the Gurudwara itself and the other two being privatised by the guesthouses. Different sections for men and women are made at the bathing place. The water in these springs contains sulphur which is capable of curing diseases. The water is hot enough to prepare food by directly placing the vessels and is served as langar."," 1. Manikaran Sahib Gurudwara  :  This Gurudwara is mentioned in the 'Twelfth Guru Khalsa' by Giani Gian Sikh. A highly revered center for worship amongst Sikhs, this Gurudwara is believed to have been visited by the Guru Nanak with his five disciples.  
 2. Shiv Temple Manikaran  :  A highly revered temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, this place attracts a huge number of tourists and pilgrims throughout the year. The temple got slightly damaged and tilted due to an earthquake in 1905. It is said that devtas of Kullu pay regular visits to this temple.  
 3. Manikaran Hot Springs	  :  These hot springs are fascinating, both as nature's marvels as well as due to the legends that surround them. The water in these hot springs contains Uranium and other radioactive elements and is believed to cure diseases.  
 4. Kulant Pith  :  The Kulant Pith is said to be the most sacred and superior of all the piths in India. It is believed that Lord Shankar stayed here for some time too, highly impressed by the place.  
 5. Harinder Mountain  :  The town of Manikaran is surrounded by the snow-capped mountains of the Harinder Mountains. The view of the town from these mountains is also breathtaking.  
 6. Lord Ramachandra Temple  :  Built in the 17th century by Raja Jagat Singh, the temple is a very popular religious center in the area. The legend behind the temple says that Lord Ram himself brought it from Ayodhya. The Lord Ramachandra Temple is also famous for its glorious idols of Lord Ram and Goddess Sita.  
", The major railway station is in Pathankot which is 300 km away. One can also travel to Manikaran from Kullu or Manali since both these tourist destinations are very close to each other.

Kargil,"  Usually a stopover for people travelling towards Leh or Padum, Kargil is a tourist hotspot that's small enough to be explored by wayfaring. Situated close to the line of control, Kargil is also a volatile region, owing to the terrorism prevalent from the other side of the LOC.

 3. Kargil main street  :  Kargil main street, being a small town, is not a shopper's paradise in the complete sense of the phrase. But the main street offers a selection of dry fruits and some great food. Some shops also sell locally produced folk music which are souvenirs for travelers.

Aurangabad,"  Aurangabad, which was declared by the Government as the Tourism Capital of Maharashtra back in 2010, is a famous tourist hub which greets its visitors with a richly woven tapestry of sights and sounds. The city got its name for being the erstwhile capital of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in the 17th century AD. The town is used as the base to explore the extremely famous caves of Ajanta and Ellora, Daulatabad Fort which is renowned for its strong defence systems, Mausoleums of Aurangzeb and Bibi-Ka-Maqbara famous for its architecture and Grishneshwar Temple, one of the only 12 Shiva Jyotirlingas in India.

Declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, the Ajanta Caves is home to 29 different caves, all of which showcase Buddhist artwork belonging to the period ranging from 200 B.C to 650 A.D.

These paintings and sculptures portray a varied range of stories, starting from the Jataka Tales to intriguing accounts of ancient nymphs and princesses. The Ellora Caves, a little distance away from the Ajanta Caves, houses a total of 34 caves and has sculptures and paintings depicting not one, but three different religions – Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. The sheer diversity of the sculptures, the architectural expertise, and the centuries of hard work undertaken by artisans are enough to leave you speechless.The sole remaining example of Mughal architecture in this part of the country, Bibi ka Maqbara is a mausoleum dedicated to Rabia-ul-Daurani, wife of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Designed by the Persian architect Ustad-Ata-Ullah, Bibi ka Maqbara has a structure similar to that of the Taj Mahal, with the main structure bordered by four towering minarets on four sides.

Lakshadweep Island,"  Formerly known as Laccadive Islands, Lakshadweep translates to 'one hundred thousand islands' in Malayalam. Home to a few of the most beautiful and exotic islands and beaches of India, Lakshadweep lies 400km off the southwest coast of the Arabian Sea. The smallest union territory of India has only 36 islands having a total area of 32 sq. kilometres. It's made up of 12 atolls, 3 reefs and 5 submerged banks out of which ten Islands are inhabited.  Lakshadweep is typically accessed from Kochi (Kerala) and a permit is required to visit Lakshadweep for all tourists (including Indians). After permit, Indians are permitted to visit all islands, however, even after permit, foreigners are permitted to just visit Agatti, Bangaram and Kadmat Islands. Permits can be obtained from Kochi itself.Perhaps the charm of Lakshadweep islands lies in their remoteness. Far off the beaten track, they attract no hordes of merrymakers to their shores. The islands, though all equally mystical and beautiful, each offers a unique blend of tourist spots. Some islands have been promoted for diving and water sports, still, others have been developed so that people enjoy the charm of relaxation."," 1. Minicoy Island  :  One of the 36 small islets of Lakshadweep group of Islands, Minicoy, also known as Maliku in the local language is one of the best-kept secrets of India.

One may explore the island on foot or rent a two-wheeler to commute.   
 3. Bangaram Island  :  Bangaram Island is a beautiful tiny island in the Union Territory of Lakshadweep, India. The Bangaram Island encompasses an area of 1.234 km2 and is the largest island in the chain of islands in the region (also known as an atoll) with a beautiful lagoon. With a population of only 10 and just one beach resort, it is an apt destination for people who want to disconnect entirely from the fast-paced world.

Chopta,"  Chopta, a small hamlet located in Uttarakhand, is a trekker's heaven. The base camp of treks like Tugnanath, Deoria Tal and Chandrashila, Chopta is an ideal destination for intermediate trekkers to go on a guided trek and brush up their skills. Chopta promises a life-altering expansion of your boundaries. The third temple of Panch Kedar is located in Tugnanath, around 3.5 km away from Chopta. Camping in the open grassy meadows of Chopta that slopes on softly, among alpine, pine, deodar and rhododendron trees is soul-fulfilling. The snow-covered peaks of Trishul, Nanda Devi and Chaukhambha dominate the panoramic views seen in Chopta."," 1. Tungnath Temple  :  The Panch Kedar are the five shrines of Lord Shiva, established by the Shaivite sect. The highest one of them, the Tungnath Temple, is located at a literally breathtaking elevation of 3860 meters.  
 2. Deori Tal  :  The Deoria Tal is located on the Ukhimath-Gopeshwar road, and is reached by a 2 km trek through Sari Village. Visiting the Deoria Tal is a wholesome experience in itself, passing the village and collecting snippets of its daily life through your camera, and if possible, then conversing with the village inhabitants.  
 3. Tungnath and Chandrashila Trek  :  The Tungnath and Chandrashila trek with its simple trail serves as one of the most astoundingly beautiful trek in Garhwal Himalayas. Chandrashila summit perched at an altitude of 4130 m is just 5 km from Chopta, which serves as its base camp.  
 4. Kanchula Korak Musk Deer Sanctuary  :  The Kanchula Korak Deer Musk Sanctuary houses the famous Musk Deer and more importantly, and abundance of lush green vegetation, a lot of varieties of which are claimed by locals to have not even been scientifically classified yet.  
 5. Ukhimath  :  Ukhimath is a destination for the devout and the followers of Hindu mythology, but everyone is welcome. As said, Ukhimath is the winter seat of Lord Kedarnath, who is temporarily shifted every year from Kedarnath, that snows in heavily during winters and unfit for travel.  
"," Chopta is a small town, so there are no airports or train stations over there. You can either reach there via buses or taxis or private cars.  "," The summer months see the largest crowds that Chopta faces, as the main trekking routes reopen. Hence, the best time to visit Chopta is during Summer from March to May. The climate is temperate and the terrain is deciduous, which means that Chopta experiences drastic changes through the seasons. The same area that looks lush and fertile in summer is arid and snowyin winter. This limits travel options to some places butpromises a brilliant time in the snowy cold. ","Shivanandi River Lodge

Kanatal,"  Once a deserted land, today Kanatal is a usual haunt for those travelers who seek peace and solitude. Kanatal is said to be named after a lake that once existed there. Apart from peace, the place exhibits a charm in form of majestic hills, fruit trees, apple orchards and lush green forests. This quaint hamlet sprinkled with plethora of wild flowers and small temples lies in the proximity to other major hill stations of the state like Dehradun (78 kms), Chamba (12 kms ahead) and Mussoorie (33 kms). Perched at the height of 8500 ft above the sea level, the salubrious weather and the untouched beauty of this place is well connected via well maintained roads unlike its other counterparts."," 1.

Planned during the construction of the dam, it today offers a sight of the massive dam with stagnant water and high mountains on all side. One can easily reach here via well maintained roads.  
 2. Dhanaulti  :  Located on the Mussoorie - Chamba route almost 22km from Kanatal, Dhanaulti is a land of hidden treasures. With very few travellers aware of the degree of beauty, the raw trails are almost untouched.  
 3. Camping  :  Camping is one of the best things to do in Kanatal. Enveloped in lush green vegetation, you can spend some leisure time relaxing under the stars, or sit by the bonfire, or take part in the various adventure activities and indoor-outdoor games organized at the camp.  
 4. Kodia Jungle  :  Kodai Jungle is paradise for photographers and nature lovers. It is an easy trek of say 5 to 6 km almost 1km from Kanatal en route Chamba. The trek amidst the thick cover of greenery affords amazing view of huge stretch of valleys and hills along with many natural springs on the course.  
 5. Homestays  :  Homestays are the best place to stay while you are on a vacation in Kanatal. These houses are typically made of mud and are in a rural setting. Besides experience the lifestyle of a typical rural setup in India, you can also interact with the locals which is a pretty insightful experience. You can cook your meals in the village, explore the village or just simply relax and rewind amidst bounteous nature.  
 6. Surkanda Devi Temple  :  Situated near Dhanaulti, Surkanda Devi Temple is perched at an exhilarating altitude of 3030m above the sea level. The temple is dedicated to Goddess Sati and is approachable by an easy trek of about 2 km.

The winters are blessed with snowfall (December-February) but the temperature falls down to 3 degrees Celcius.The place looks magical during the season and heavy woollens are a must to carry. Kanatal's weather is perpetually cold and gives off a remarkably calm effect for all the tourists and locals alike. Monsoon in the area brings down heavy rainfall after which the place looks absolutely refreshed and blooming, although it is best to avoid the rainy season.When visiting Kanatal, one must look out for the various trekking tales, dense exploratory jungles, and other mountains and rivers which have formed a special place in every visitor's heart.

Mawsynram,"  Acknowledged as the wettest place in the world, the mesmerizing village of Mawsynram, located 61 kms south of Shillong is a nature lover's delight and the perfect destination for a weekend trip. Mawsynram trounces Cherrapunjee by a slight margin in being the wettest place in India. The 'Maw' in Mawsynram is a Khasi word meaning 'stone'. It symbolizes the unique megaliths unearthed in the Khasi Hill area. The village is well known for its huge formation of a stalagmite, which takes after the shape of a 'Shivling'. Located in the East Khasi Hill district of Meghalaya, Mawsynram is 1400 m above sea level. The rains are so powerful in Mawsynram that the local villagers have to make use of thick grass to sound-proof their homes from the thunderous rain."," 1. Mawsmai Caves  :  The holy cave of the Khasis is in the Mawsmai village. The cave is almost 150 m long and it is easy to pass through. The Mawsmai caves are an ideal location for cave exploration and cave diving.  
 2. Mawsmai Falls  :  Known as the fourth highest waterfall in India, Mawsmai Falls are situated a little away from Mawsynram. The height of the waterfall is 1,035 ft. It is a seven-segmented waterfall, which rushes over the top of limestone cliffs of the Khasi Hills.  
 3. Nohalikalai Falls  :  Crowned the fifth highest waterfall of India, Nohkalikai is situated about five km from Mawsynram. Water falls from a height of 1,000 ft unstoppably from the highest peak to the bottom of the falls making it a fantabulous tourist attraction.  
 4. Mawlyngbna  :  About 25 km away from Mawsynram, Mawlyngbna is known for rich fossils and a natural geyser.  
 5. Cherrapunjee  :  Referred to as Sohra and Churra, Cherrapunjee gives you a million reasons to visit it. It is known as the second wettest place of this earth and the only place in India to receive rainfall the entire year long.  
"," Mawsynram is situated 3 hours away from the capital of Meghalaya, Shillong. Therefore, Shillong Airport also known as Umroi Airport is the nearest airport to Mawsynram. At times there are no direct flights to Shillong and then Guwahati Airport comes to the rescue.There are no railway connections in Meghalaya hence Guwahati Railway Station is the nearest railway station located at a distance of 104 km from Shillong. Interstate buses from Shillong and Guwahati run through the neighbouring states, giving you a picturesque view of nearby areas as you travel.
  "," Mawsynram is known to be one of the wettest places on the planet. It is, therefore, best when visited between April and June which is the summer season in the country. This beautiful tourist site in the “abode of clouds” provides for a delightful respite during the summers as the temperature remains pleasantly cool all through the day. Some may choose to visit Mawsynram at the onset or by the end of the monsoon season, i.e. in July/ September-October to experience the lovely ambience, but since it is one of the wettest places in India, they need to be aware and equipped for the heavy rainfall the region witnesses. The transitioning month of October is also quite a pleasant time to explore the tourist attractions as the terrain is consistently covered with lush greenery and the air is refreshing and rejuvenating. Most of the day during this time of the year is misty and foggy creating a magical charm that cannot be ignored. The region receives rainfall almost all through the year. So no matter which month tourists plan to visit, they must be prepared for unexpected showers. ","Emily and Sankrita's  Homestay at Mawsynram

Apart from the summers, the winter and monsoons experience moderate climate hence visiting Chikhaldara at any time of the year will be a satisfying and fulfilling experience. ","Amruta Homestays

Badami,"  Located in a valley of rugged red sandstone, surrounding the Agastya Lake, Badami (formerly known as Vatapi) is an archaeological delight owing to its beautifully crafted sandstone cave temples, fortresses and carvings. Located in the Bagalkot district in Karnataka, Badami is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites that constitute Aihole-Badami-Pattadakal and is the finest example of traditional temple architecture in India.  Once the royal capital of the Chalukyas, Badami is home to a number of examples of Dravidian architecture which have instances of both South and North Indian styles of architecture. There are three Hindu Temples and one Jain Temple in Badami Caves. Rock climbing is a popular activity here for people looking for some adventure too. "," 1. Cave Temples  :  The Cave Temples of Badami consist of four separate temples, each holding intricate carvings and depictions.  
 2. Agastya Lake  :  Said to possess healing powers, this lake faces all the caves of Badami and is surrounded by the red sandstone temples.  
 3. Badami Fort  :  The fort was built by Tipu Sultan in the 18th century. Perched on the top of a cliff, this fort is accompanied by two Shivalaya complexes dating back to the 5th century. A 16th century and a 14th century watchtower are also featured atop this hill.  
 4. Aihole  :  While in Badami, take a day trip to Aihole, history's storehouse of temples. With countless ancient temples, partly claimed by ruins, the town is a walk through early architectural styles and structures, with a charm borrowed from the past, hanging around.  
 5. Bhuthanatha Temples  :  The two temples facing the Agastya lake, are known as the Bhuthanatha temples. Built of local sandstone, they are dedicated to Lord Shiva, in the form of Bhuthanatha.  
 6. City Shopping  :  Take home some hand made artifacts and rugs from Badami. Shop for sandalwood and rosewood sculptures as well as traditional jewellery.  
 7. Archaeological Museum  :  This Archaeological Museum was founded in 1979. Consisting of four separate galleries, two of which are open air, this museum has various exhibits ranging from mythological to prehistoric times, dating back to the 6th century.  
 8. Banashankari Temple  :  Banashankari temple, also known as Banashankari Amma temple, is located at Cholachagudd near Badami, Karnataka. It is one amongst the most famous Hindi shrines in the state. Several stories and beliefs revolve around the temple regarding its construction, history, and culture. However, the most exciting fact about this temple is that the people worship 'Rahukala' which is considered inauspicious as per Hindu culture. The devotees pray to Rahukala to let go of all the miseries, poverty and inauspiciousness from their life.  
 9. Pattadakal  :  Another town in much proximity to Badami is Pattadakal and is also known for its temple and the intricate and varied styles of architecture that they exhibit.  
 10. Malegitti Shivalaya Fort and Temple  :  A grand example of ancient Chalukya architecture, the Malegitti Shivalaya Fort and Temple are a series of elegantly carved, rock-cut structures spread out across the massive red boulder, overlooking the small town of Badami. The temples were built in the 7th century, and these structures are perhaps the earliest and best surviving examples of the magnificence of the Dravida style in the early Chalukya architecture. Along with the temples, the rocky edifice also houses the north fort and remnants of the storage facilities for food and weapons.  
 11. Mahakuta Temples  :  Situated on the outskirts of Badami in the tiny village of Mahakuta, the Mahakuta group of temples are an architectural delight, mirroring the unique rock-cut construction pattern of the Chalukyas seen across Badami. These temples combine the ancient architectural elements of the Dravidian and Nagara styles, as is seen at the various temples of this region.  
 12. Mallikarjuna Temple  :  Within the Bhootanatha temple cluster by the beautiful Agastya Lake of Badami lies the elegantly designed Mallikarjuna Temple. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, the temple, along with smaller shrines built around it, was constructed in a star-shaped plan in the 11th century. Its structure is representative of the Chalukyan architectural influence seen on a majority of the historical buildings in this heritage town.  
 13. Lower Shivalaya  :  Built in the 7th century by the ancient Chalukyan dynasty, the Lower Shivalaya temple is part of a series of temples situated across the northern hill of Badami. This intricately carved rock-cut structure perhaps the earliest and best-surviving example of the magnificence of the Dravida style in the early Chalukya architecture.  
 14. Upper Shivalaya  :  Situated on top of the northern hill of Badami, the Upper Shivalaya is a fine example of the rock-cut architectural style of the ancient Chalukyan empire. Built in the 7th century, this impressive structure gives one a magnificent panoramic view of the town of Badami and the beautiful Agastya lake.  
"," Badami can only be accessed by road and rail and is connected to all major cities. The closest airport is at Belgaum (150km). Badami has a small station of its own where trains from cities like Bangalore and Bijapur halt regularly. This town can also be accessed by bus, with the bus stand being located in the centre of the town.  "," The geographical location makes it a semi-arid region, and therefore, Winter and Springi.e October to Aprilis the best time to visit Badami. The temperature during this time of the year usually remains moderate allowing tourists to explore the site to the fullest. The monsoon seasonis pleasant too as the region does not receive continuous heavy downpours. While summers are not recommendeddue to soaring temperatures, the seasonal showers begin slowly cooling the town. ","KSTDC Hotel Mayura Chalukya, Badami

Kashid,"  A Beach town, popular for its white sand and blue seas situated in Konkan region of Maharashtra, Kashid is the perfect destination for a quiet weekend getaway from Mumbai. A soothing and calm place in nature's lap, Kashid is mildly enchanting with its quiet environment and picturesque location. This beach town is known also for its majestic mountains and whispering Casuarinas. A delightful place for those seeking a serene environment, Kashid is has a calm shore that stretches to a vast extent and presents with a spellbound appearance. Kashid's spotless water and clean beach make it one of the most beautiful spots in the nearby areas. A drive through the area in itself is a great experience. Chaul, which lies near Kashid, has many Buddhist caves that are of public interest, and also famous churches and temples. The Korlai Fort is another beautiful attraction here."," 1. Kashid Beach  :  One of the most popular and alluring beaches of Maharashtra, the Kashid beach comes with a promise of a perfect and relaxed beach holiday. The sun kissed, white, clean sandy beach with crystalline water is full of natural beauty that offers a dream destination for water enthusiasts.The Casuarinas groves, which sway to the tune of the gentle sea breeze are also in plenty here.  
 2. Murud Janjira Fort  :  About 21 km from Kashid Beach, this fort is surrounded by the turquoise colored waters of the Arabian Sea. Dating back to 15th century AD, built under the rule of Emperor Malik Amber, the ruler of Ahmednagar, the structure sports an enchanting entrance to the fort depicting a carving of a tiger trapped by six elephants.  
 3. Phansad Bird Sanctuary  :  Though referred to as a bird sanctuary, the Pansad Bird Sanctuary also houses many amphibians, insects and mammals. This one isn't flocked with people and hence is a quiet and calm place to visit.  
 4. Korlai Fort  :  A Portuguese structure, this is an old fort atop a hill and a major tourist attraction now. The picturesque location of the fort is the highlight - surrounded by water on three sides and a lighthouse.  
 5. Shopping in Kashid  :  While in Kashid, intersperse your strolls at the beach with the shopping experience it provides. One can get their hands on jewelry, handicrafts and wooden items, items made from shells as well as coconut based items.  
 6. Revdanda Beach and Fort  :  The ruins of the Portuguese fort are veiled in wild plantations. What stand out are the cannon holes in the fortification walls that border the sea. Even though the fort is now in ruins, the pure historic charm combined with the nature's exotic beauty - the Ravdanda beach - make this a must visit place.  
 7. Datta Mandir  :  Datta Mandir is a red-domed temple situated atop a hill, at a distance of 18 km from Kashid Beach. A road to the temple is available, but a trek up to the same tends to be a popular choice as well.  
"," Kashid has a well-maintained system of roads which connect it to Alibag and consequently to the other major cities of Maharashtra like Mumbai and Pune. MSRTC runs a regular bus service on the route from Alibag to Murud which pass through Kashid. It takes around 1.5-2 hours to reach Kashid by bus.To reach Kashid from Mumbai, other than during the monsoon season, ferries are the most convenient way to reach Kashid via Alibag. There is a very regular ferry service from Gateway of India to Mandwa jetty and then Alibag, from where you can take the frequent (almost hourly) bus to Kashid from Alibag bus stand.Kashid doesn't have any airport or railway station. The nearest airport is Chhatrapati Shivaji International airport in Mumbai. The nearest railway station is at Panvel.   "," The best time to visit Kashid is from October to February when the weather remains pleasant and suitable for water sports and beach activities. During summers, days are hot and humid while the evenings are mostly pleasant. Monsoons from June to August are extremely uncomfortable as it hinders sightseeing as well as other activities. Kashid is at a distance of 125 km from Mumbai, hence a great weekend getaway. ","Sahil campsite

Shivagange,"  Shivagange, a hillock situated 56 km from Bangalore, is a combination of temples and scenic beauty that makes it both a pilgrimage as well as an adventure spot. From a distance, the hillock looks like a 'Shiva Linga', with a spring flowing nearby that's locally called Ganga, thereby naming it Shivaganga. It is also given the name Dakshina Kashi (Kashi of the south) since it's home to various temples (Gangadhareshwara temple, Olakala Teertha, Nandi Statue, Patala Gange, etc.) The stone carving of Nandi ( the bull) is another primary attraction. The hilly feature of the place attracts a lot of adventure sports seekers, providing them opportunities for trekking and rock climbing. All in all, it is a popular getaway for travellers with both religious and adventurous inclinations"," 1. Trekking in Shivagange  :  A collection of solid rock structures, Shivagange offers climbers an exciting and tough trek.

"
Shekhawati,"  Shekhawati is a semi-arid getaway full of open air galleries, enchanting havelis & palaces and legendary forts. This region has been recognised as the open art gallery of Rajasthan"""" having the largest concentration of frescos in the world."" Shekhawati has a history similar to that of Nawalgarh where in the Marwari men went to cities like Bombay and Calcutta in search of work and the time they found success and their businesses flourished, that is exactly when these plush havelis emanated. One businessman competed with the other in showing off his wealth, this continued on and on and finally, what the business families of Shekhawati got was an affluent city to live in. The inhabitants of Shekhawati are considered brave, sacrificing and hard working people. The region provides one of the highest number of people to the Indian Army. Hence, this location makes up for a dreamscape for all those wishing to get a blast from the past."," 1. Sikar  :  Sikar is one of the most preferred excursions away from Shekhawati. It is host to plenty of prolific havelis and temples namely the Ram Chokhani Haveli, Bansidhar Rathi Haveli, Mirijamal Kyala Haveli, Kedia Haveli, Sanganeria Haveli, Radha Murli Manohar temple and the Jeen Mata temple are the relatively more famous ones.

 3. Nawalgarh  :  Nawalgarh is a miniature town situated at a short distance from Shekhawati.

 7. Dundlod  :  While Nawalgarh is famous for its havelis and forts built in the 20th century, this town of Dundlod is famous for the edifices built in the 18th century.  
 8. Horseback Riding  :  A breathtaking experience it is to take a ride through Shekhavati, which still reverberates of old Rajasthani culture, and takes one through the glorious past of the merchants of the Silk Road, all on horseback. On the back of exclusive Marwadi horses, one can soak in Rajasthani life, culture and havelis.  
 9. Laxmangarh Fort  :  Situated at a distance of 147 kms from Jaipur, Laxmangarh Fort was built by Rao Raja of Sikar, Laxman Singh in the 19th century. Built on large scattered rocks, the fort is now partly owned by private party and hence is only partially open to tourists.  
 10. Mandawa Fort  :  Mandawa Fort is striking example of unique Rajasthani style architecture. Built in the 18th century by Nawal Singh, the fort is situated 170 kms from Jaipur and boasts of beautiful archways, mirror works and paintings.  
 11. Ratangarh Fort  :  Built in the 19th century by Maharaja Ratan Singh of Rajasthan, Ratangarh Fort is situated at a distance of 200 kms from Jaipur. Dotted with imposing gateways and elaborate designs, the fort also has a clock tower known as Ghantaghar.  
"," Shekhawati is well connected to the rest of India by rail and road. Regular rail and bus services ply to and fro the city of Shekhawati, buses being operated both by private and government owners, especially the Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation. There is no direct flight connectivity, however, to Shekhawati Some 200 km away is the Jaipur International Airport in Jaipur, which is the nearest airport that connects Shekhawati to the rest of India.

Bundi,"  A princely state for a princely stay, in the northwest of India, lies the district of Bundi, in the Hadoti region of the royal state of Rajasthan. In ancient times, the area around Bundi was apparently inhabited by various local tribes. Bundi was previously called 'Bunda-Ka-Nal""; Nal meaning 'narrow ways'. It is said to derive its name from a former Meena tribe man called Bunda Meena. Later the region was governed by Rao Deva Hada who took over Bundi from Jaita Meena in 1342 and established a princely state Bundi renaming the surrounding area called Hadoti the land of great Hada Rajputs. Bundi is home to some of the most magnificent palaces, majestic forts, its baolis (meaning water wells or step wells), haves, temples and chhatris with carved pillars.  "," 1. Taragarh Fort  :  The most significant of the tourists attractions here is this fort built somewhere in the 16th century. It is included amongst the most famous ones in Rajasthan for its intricate structures and a highly-regarded painting gallery (from here originated the Bundi style of mural painting).  
 2. Moti Mahal, Bundi  :  Bundi is a small town in the Hadoti region of Rajasthan, which lies 250 km away from the capital city of Rajasthan and 39 km from Kota. The town is famous for its picturesque forts, steep-wells (baolis), palaces, lakes, and reservoirs. Moti Mahal is one of the unmatched attractions of the town. Along with the historic beauty of the Moti Mahal Palace, you can also enjoy the panoramic view of the arid Aravali hills in the backdrop along with the view of the ancient Nagal Sagar Lake.  
 3. Badal Mahal, Bundi  :  The Badal Mahal is located in the premises of the Taragarh Fort. The walls of this majestic palace are covered with exquisite paintings. These paintings are interesting since they depict an influence of Chinese culture.  
 4. Garh Palace  :  The Garh palace has a number of petite palaces built encircling the central majestic residence. The various rulers of the city built these small palaces. The palace has many tales attached to it.  
 5. Sukh Mahal  :  Sukh Mahal, which is located on the periphery of the lake Jait Sagar was built during Umed Singh's regime. It is a universal belief that the old palace and Sukh Mahal are connected by means of an underground tunnel.  
 6. Chaurasi Khambon ki Chattri  :  For all those who are enthusiastic about historical sites and structures, this one is a delight for you. It is a marquee supported by 84 pillars. The marquee was built in 1683 by Rao Anirudh Singh to honor the services of Deva, who was a nurse.  
 7. Bhoraji-ka-Kund  :  Bhoraji-ka-Kund is surely a must see spot and will impress you by its beauty. Built in the 16th century, such water bodies were constructed in the olden days as a source of water for the drought hit areas of Bundi.  
 8. Nawal Sagar Lake  :  Nawal Sagar Lake is a huge, man made lake that can be seen from the Talagarh Fort. This lake has more than a few small islands. This lake is located in the middle of the city, and hence, one can get to see the reflection of the entire city in this lake.  
 9. Phool Mahal, Bundi  :  The Phool Sagar Lake derives its name from the Phool Mahal, which is a huge fortress that stands on its banks. The Phool Mahal or the Flower palace is a comparatively contemporary construction and was started in the year 1945 by the Maharaja Bahadur Singh.  
 10. Chhattra Mahal  :  Among all the palaces around the Taragarh Fort, the Chatar Mahal is possibly the best. It was built in the year 1660 by Chatar Sal, and bears a strong proof of the state of independence that the Rajput rulers enjoyed from Mughal power.  
 11. Hathi Pol  :  The Hathi Pol is an entrance into the Garh Palace of Bundi. Two enormous gates are seen at the end of a steep climb to this palace. Pol, which literally means Door, The Hathi Pol is a massive entrance that has two trumpeting elephants that form an arc.  
 12. Shikar Burj  :  Shikar Burj is another tourist destination in the quaint city of Bundi. Located at a little distance from Sukh Mahal, Shikar Burj is actually an old hunting cottage owned by the rulers of Bundi.  
 13. Step Wells  :  The step-wells of the town are a trademark feature of Bundi. These wells were constructed as a means of providing water to the famine prone town of Bundi.  
 14. Bundi Utsav  :  The Bundi Utsav comes each year in the month of November-December to give a new life to the town of Bundi in Rajasthan state. An extravaganza of customs, traditions, and traditional art forms, the Bundi Utsav has it all for the visitors in terms of representing the cultural richness of the state of Rajasthan in general and that of the town of Bundi in particular.   
"," Bundi is well connected to the rest of India by roadways. Regular bus services ply to and fro the city of Bundi;  buses being operated both by private and government owners. There is no direct flight or rail connectivity, however, as of now, available to Bundi. Some 210 km away is the Jaipur International airport, which is the nearest airport that connects Bundi to the rest of India.  The nearest railway station accessible for Bundi is in Kota, 40 km away from Bundi.
  "," Bundi's weather is pretty much same as the weather in the rest of Rajasthan. The summers in this region are extremely hot and dry, with the maximum temperature during daytime reaching up to 35 - 43 degrees Celcius, the days here are extremely dry with hot winds blowing. As it gets closer to night time, the temperature slowly begins to drop, making it a little cooler. During the winter season, the weather here gets extremely chilly, with the temperature dropping down to 5 degrees Celcius. The winters in this place are an absolute delight. The rainfalls in Bundi are restricted to the months of July till mid September. The monsoons here make days extremely humid, with the level of humidity reaching up to 90%. So keeping all of the above in mind, the best time to visit Bundi is from October to March, when climatic conditions remain cool and pleasant. ","Dev Niwas - Heritage Hotel

Dhanushkodi,"  Dhanushkodi is a small, sparsely populated beach town on the coast of Tamil Nadu. In the 1964, Dhanushkodi was hit by one of the worst storms India has ever seen. Ever since then, Tamil Nadu has rebuilt this town to become one of the most unique and unusual beach towns of India. This small town redefines the term isolated. Cut off from the rest of the world, this town seems untouched by time. While the rest of India is vying to get ahead in the race for prosperity, this town seems frozen in history, reflecting it grandeur and beauty."," 1. Dhanushkodi Beach  :  The Dhanushkodi Beach is one of the few major attractions this quaint town has to offer. The white sand beach is mostly deserted. So you can enjoy a silent walk on the beach, without worrying about disturbances from a large crowd of beach goers.  
 2. Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park  :  The Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park is one of the few Marine National Parks in the country. The park consists of 21 islands along with estuaries, mudflats, beaches and forests.  
 3. Adam's Bridge  :  Adam's Bridge, a natural bridge than connects India with its neighbouring country Sri Lanka is set amid a gorgeous setting of raw nature that can leave anyone awe inspired by its beauty.   
 4. Pamban island  :  Located about 20 km away from Dhanushkodi, this island is another called the Pamban Island. The deep blue sea island is yet another spectacle and is considered as one of the most beautiful islands in the region. Travelers can go there by crossing the Pamban Bridge.  
 5. Church and Station Ruins  :  Before the cyclone hit Dhanushkodi, back in 1964, there was a railway station and church close to the shore. They got destroyed in the cyclone, but their remnants survive and are simply fascinating.  
 6. Ramar Patham temple  :  About 20 km away from Dhanushkodi is the Ramar Patham Temple. The temple is believed to have foot prints of Lord Ram Himself, on a stone. It is believed that it is at this place, Lord Hanuman told Lord Ram that he had found Goddess Sita in Sri Lanka.  
"," There are no direct transport services to Dhanushkodi. You can reach there by bus or cab from Rameshwaram, the nearest town.  "," The winter months from October to February are the best time to visit Dhanushkodi. The summer isn't very hot either. So if you aren't averse to the heat, then summer months are open as well. The monsoon months not only see frequent showers but also mild storms. The tourists, therefore, generally steer clear of Dhanushkodi from July to September. ","Hotel NNP Grand

Madhyamaheshwar,"  A small sacred town of Madhyamaheshwar is a place full of mysteries and blessed with bounty of nature. Renowned for its Madhyamaheshwar Temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, it gathers the whole hamlet to pray in the evening along with many tourists. Dusted with small huts, villages with their own culture and unique traditions, this quaint little town has an essence of old world. It beautiful backdrop of snow covered Himalayas, sprawling alpine meadows and thick cover of forests adds more charm to its beauty. Temple in typical North Indian style structure and salubrious weather throughout the year completes the beautiful sepia tinted picture of this place. Situated at an altitude of 3265 m above the sea level, Madhyamaheshwar has spiritual vibes oozing out of it which are difficult to ignore."," 1. Madhyamaheshwar Temple  :  Perched over an elevation of 3490 m above the sea level, the trek to this temple is quite a task. However, it is not without a fruit. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, this temple is considered to be one of the oldest religious places in India.  
 2. Kanchani Tal  :  Kanchani tal is 16 km farther away from Madhyamaheshwar, which can again be reached by a trek. However, the trek to this place is deemed to be quite difficult, so do visit only if you are prepared.  
 3. Budha Madhyamaheshwar  :  Situated 2km from Madhyamaheshwar, this holy shrine is a cluster of rocks. However, the journey to this place quite captivating with picturesque views of various peaks can be seen from here such as Kedarnath, Neelkanth, Trishul, Kamet and Panchachuli over a small lake. Do visit this place for an enchanting experience.  
 4. Omkareshwar Temple  :  The Madhyamaheshwar Omkareshwar Temple is an integral part of the great Panch Kedar and is dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is simply known as Ukhimath Omkareshwar Temple. During the winters, the idols from Kedarnath temple and Madhyamaheshwar are brought to Ukhimath and worshipped here for six months. Ukhimath is a small pilgrimage town in the Rudraprayag District of Uttarakhand. No one from here is believed to leave empty-handed. The devotees here are showered with the blessings of Lord Shiva.   
"," Located in a hilly terrain, Madhmaheshwar does not hold a railway station or an airport. However, Madhmaheshwar can be reached from the Rishikesh Railway Station as it is the nearest railway station to it. Similarly, one can reach Madhmaheshwar from Jolly Grant Airport (Dehradun). From the airport and the railway station, one can reach a point from where one has to trek the remaining distance to reach the sacred temple as a journey by road is not possible beyond a certain point. There are two possible ways to reach the temple via trekking, one is by going to Ukhimath and from there to Unaina village, from the village a trek of 21 km will take you to the Madhmaheshwar temple. Another possible way is to reach Guptakashi, from here a 30 km long trek will take you to the temple. Out of the 30 km trek from Guptakashi, 7 km is motorable, so one has to go through a trek of 23 km by foot.  "," Madhyamaheshwar is a small village which experiences moderate weather throughout the year. The summers are warm but pleasant while winters can get cold. It is best to travel to Madhyamaheshwar between the months of May and October. The main attraction of the place, Madhyamaheshwar Temple remains closed from November to April. So if your purpose of travelling is spiritual, prefer not to travel during the duration mentioned above. The monsoon season experiences almost no rainfall. ","Rhododendron forest- Mud Hut @ Chopta :)

The biggest temple out of the lot of the 124 temples here, is the one that is the most visited, the Jageshwar Mahadev Temple is situated on the Jataganga Valley.

The long and short of Jageshwar then remains, that if you're an archaeological geek, with a thing for exploring the deeply seated mythological beliefs that for the root of the Indian culture, the place will leave you feeling enchanted, with an unquenchable thirst of exploring beyond."," 1. Mahamrityunjaya Temple  :  Shiva is believed to be the savior and redeemer of all his devotees, even delivering them from death, or as in Hindu mythology, the ruler of the underworld, Yamraj, who collects the souls of the deceased from the terrestrial realm.  
 2. Jageshwar Mahadev Temple  :  This temple is by far the most visited temple in the whole complex, dedicated to the incarnation of Shiva in the form of a child. The story goes as Shiva being an attractive alpha male to all the women folk of the village, where he used to meditate.  
 3. Archaeological Museum, Jageshwar  :  The Archaeological Museum, maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India, houses yet another exquisite collection of the anciently carved idols and old world representations of the deities.  
 4. Dandeshwar Temple  :  An epitome of Nagar style architecture, the Dandeshwar Temple is as tall as you can crane your neck, quite literally. It is believed to house the shrine of Lord Shiva as the staff bearer, hence the name Dandeshwar, or the bearer of the 'dand', the staff.  
"," Jageshwar has direct road links from Pithoragarh, Haldwani, Almora and Kathgodam. The nearest rail head is Kathgodam, located around 125 km away. State transport buses and private jeeps and taxis regularly ply to and fro Jageshwar.   "," April to June, September to November are the best months to visit Jageshwar. The spring and early monsoons are the best time to visit Jageshwar, merely for the pleasant day and night weather, which are favourable for the extensive travelling around the area for sightseeing and further exploration. The two popular festivals of the chief deity Shiva are also held during the same seasons. The Shivratri Mela takes place during the spring, while the Jageshwar Festival, in monsoons, is a vibrant affair, attracting visitors and natives alike. ","StayApart - Jai Maa Tulsi Guest House

Nelong Valley,"  Nelong Valley lies 45km away from the Indo-Tibetan border, around 256km from Dehradun, Uttarakhand. It is considered to be one of the most thrilling mountaineering treks in India.  At a height of 11,000ft, the view from here is breathtaking. The valley offers a clear and surreal view of the Tibetan Plateau. Gartang Gali, a wooden walkway, is a main attraction of the valley said to have been built in the 17th Century. It was known as one of the main routes for trade between India & China in 1962.",," Nelong Valley is a sensitive zone in Uttarakhand and does not have any direct road, train or flight access. The closest airport is the Dehradun International Airport. The nearby train stations are Harrawala, Dehradun and Rishikesh. Harrawala has limited connectivity by train. Once you reach any of these locations, you would have to go to Uttarkashi by road. You can reach Uttarkashi by bus or drive or hire a taxi. Permit: Upon reaching Uttarkashi, there are various permissions that will have to be taken. You have to make a detailed application to the District Magistrate in Uttarkarshi asking for permission to enter the restricted area of Nelong Valley. If the application is accepted, you can take this order to the forest department and the local intelligence unit to get your final approval. These documents have to be taken to the Sub-divisional magistrate again for a final Permit. This whole process can take upto 3 days so it would be wise to organise it in advance.You can drive to Nelong Valley after receiving your permit.  "," The best time to visit Nelong Valley is May-June or September-October. This is when it is not too cold or under heavy snowfall, nor is it raining heavily. During the monsoons or winters, the weather is unpleasant. The route also requires dry weather as there are possibilities of landslides. The valley is not open after November. ",,,,

The chief tributary of the holy river Ganges, called Bhagirathi, originates from Gaumukh. The name Gaumukh itself, can be broken down to Gau- meaning cow, and Mukh - meaning mouth.

But winters are almost quite as crowded besides the freezing and chilly weather, as Narkanda serves as an idyllic hub for skiing in the lap of Himachal Shivalik Ranges. Winters in Narkanda are cold and covered in snow, and that is all the more reason why people prefer to visit the small town. People interested in skiing should visit during this season. The monsoons bring moderate rainfall. Hence, if you're not a very cold loving person, then summertime is perfect for you. ","Echor- Narkanda Cottages

Digha,"  Beach town situated on the shores of Bay of Bengal, Digha is a popular tourist destination known for its untouched beaches and scenic views, especially among people in West Bengal. Digha is a one-stop destination for families looking forward to spend a pleasurable weekend. One of the best features of this hamlet is its varied and diverse tourist attraction spots. Known for its magnificent beaches, religious temples and high-tech research centers and museums, this most popular sea resort of West Bengal has a lot to offer for people of all age groups. Digha's sceneries can also offer you the pleasure experienced in witnessing areas that have minimal human impact and are relatively untouched."," 1. Marine Station/Aquarium of Zoological Survey of India  :  MARC - Marine aquarium cum regional centre - is a major tourist attraction for all Digha visitors. It has the largest inbuilt aquarium in India. The aquarium has three kinds of creatures: species of conservative importance, 'local and curious' species and freshwater species.  
 2. New Digha Beach  :  This one is a man-made beach, created 2 km away from the old one. It is better planned and more easily accessible from nearby hotels. The new beach is bigger, less crowded and better maintained compared to the Old Digha beach.  
 3. Udaipur Beach  :  If you're looking for a more laidback and tranquil beach atmosphere, Udaipur beach is the right place to visit. The beach has lonely, deserted stretches of seashore where you can just walk along, take a dip in the water or just rent a bike to roam around.  
 4. Shankarpur Beach  :  15 km from Digha, Shankarpur is a virgin beach with a lovely view of the beach surrounded by local fish boats and rows of tress giving visitors the perfect Kodak moment. Near the beach, there are also a few temples in Shankarpur.  
 5. Talsari Beach  :  Lined with coconut and palm trees all along, Talasari beach is famous among sea food lovers for the delicacies it offers. The place has an amazing view with all the stretches of greens peeking through the mountains and the rivers.  
 6. Amarabati Park  :  With neatly paved walkways, a multitude of seating areas, verdant surroundings, a gorgeous ropeway ride and boating facilities to enjoy its own mini-lake, the Amarabati park provides wholesome family fun for children and adults looking for a relaxed manner of killing some time during their vacation in the beautiful Digha.  
 7. Temple at Chandaneswar  :  Situated at a distance of 6-8 km from Digha, Chandaneswar Shiv temple has mythology and folklore depicting its creation and history. The temple plays host to a huge annual fair on the first day of Oriya calendar and sees an influx of a large number of tourists every year.  
 8. Old Digha Beach  :  Old Digha Beach is one of the less popular beaches in Digha and experiences relatively less tourism. Although there are no shacks or eating joints on the beach, there are however, stone seats made for people to sit and relax. There are stone crumbles and boulders formed due to erosion, that dominate the area. However, it is still considered an ideal place to watch the sunsets and sunrises.  
 9. Chandpur Beach  :  Flanked on the coast of the Bay of Bengal, Chandpur Beach is one of the less popular and less crowded beaches near Kolkata. Boasting of a beautiful sea side view and clear emerald water, the beach is considered ideal to relax and unwind. The beach, however, is different than the other beaches in the region. Its banks are slightly eroded and there is recession caused by the sea water.  
"," The nearest airport from Digha is the Netaji Subash Chandra Bose International Airport of Kolkata which is located at a distance of around 150 km from Digha. The airport is well connected to main cities of India. Bus services are available in Digha. There are two bus stands within the city. Around 450 metres away from Digha is the railway station which is connected to nearby cities through regular trains.
  "," Digha, a perfect weekend getaway for all those who live in West Bengal is the most enticing during winters. October to February is the best time to hit the beaches at Digha. Apart from beaches, there are aquariums and gardens to cover, for which the most comfortable time is during these months. Winter is also the time for the biggest celebration in the whole of Bengal- Durga Puja. Summers in Digha are hot and uncomfortable with temperatures rising up to 37 degrees celcius. This isn't an ideal time to visit the palce. Whereas in July the monsoon rains might wash away your plans to enjoy both beaches and amusement parks.The level of humidity is higher making it less pleasant to travel. ","Le Roi Digha

The monsoons with full generosity in showers may make travelling a little difficult but the lush green surroundings might just make up for it. Aside from spotting these majestic beasts in their natural habitat, Sundarban National Park also has an abundance of diverse flora and fauna that make visiting the attraction worth it. The climate in and around this area generally follows the pattern of most Indian cities, and thus, it has three distinct seasons, out of which the winters are the most prefered, though all of them have their pros and cons.

Bhedaghat,"  Bhedaghat is known for the Dhuandar Falls (Dhuan means smoke and Dhar means flow), a huge cascade of water that falls from a height of 98 feet. Boating in Bhedaghat especially during the moonlit night would surely make up for an unforgettable experience. The boatmen of these place are storytellers that will tell you about the place in the form of interesting stories.Also regarded as the Marble Rocks of Bhedaghat, this small town has earned a reputation for the massive 100 ft rocks on either side of the Narmada. Bhedaghat is in close proximity of one of the major cities of Madhya Pradesh of Jabalpur The other notable attractions include 64 Yogini Temple and 'Bandar Kudini', a spot where two cliffs are so close to each other that monkeys hop over from one side to another."," 1. Marble Rocks  :  Bollywood fans, rejoice! For this is exactly the place where Shahrukh Khan wooed Kareena Kapoor in one of his films - Ashoka. The humongous limestone and magnesium rocks flank the river Narmada giving it the tourists an ethereal view of the many scenic locales that Bhedaghat has to offer.  
 2. Dhuandhar Falls  :  As the Narmada River swiftly paves its way through the exquisite Marble Rocks, it reaches a culmination point where it narrows down and plunges into a waterfall which is famously known as the Dhuandhar Falls.  
 3. Chausath Yogini Temple  :  Dedicated to goddess Durga, considered as the mother of the universe in Hindu mythology, this temple built in the 10th century temple has intricately designed stone figures of deities belonging to the Kalchuri period.  
 4. Shopping in Bhedaghat  :  Bhedaghat is famous for its marble artefacts.  
 5. Soapstone Artefacts  :  This is like the local market outside the Marble Rocks which is run by the locals who are talented enough to carve out small, complicate and flawless artefacts and marble idols. Get your hands on them!  
"," Bhedaghat does not have an airport or a railway junction of its own. To commute to Bhedaghat, the closest airport is Jabalpur Airport and the closest railway station is Jabalpur Junction. Both railway junction and airport are hardly 40 km away. Roadways are also connected to Jabalpur as it is one of the main cities in Madhya Pradesh. 
  "," The best time to visit Bhedaghat is from November-May. The summers are quite moderate here with temperatures reaching up to 30-34 degrees Celcius, while the winters are relatively more pleasant and colder with temperatures dropping down to 10 degrees Celcius at nights. The monsoon experiences heavy rainfalls (June 15 - October 15) and the Marble Rocks are also shut during the time, which means a trip to Bhedaghat will certainly not be a fruitful one.

The Pookot Lake, Chembara Peak, Soojipara & Meenmutty Falls and theÊMuthangaWildlife Sanctuary are its major attractions."," 1.

"," October to April (winter) is the besttime to visit Vythiri, however,the pleasant climate makes Vythiri worth a visit throughout the year.Summer (April to June) is the best off-season time to visit Vythiri.The off-season prices are a steal as well, with accommodation at luxurious resorts and homestays costing way lesser than seasonal prices.The hill station of Wayanad experiences 20 days of rainfall per month between July and September(monsoon) and Vythiri is no exception. There is a risk of landslides as well, so speak to the local authorities before you plan a visit to Vythiri in the monsoon. ","Zostel Wayanad

 3. Ashok Pillar  :  This pillar was put up in the 3rd century and its structure is influenced by the Greco Buddhist style. A remnant of Sanchi's ancient history, this pillar still stands strong and appears newly built despite being centuries old. It also resembles the Sarnath pillar a lot.  
 4. The Eastern Gateway  :  The four Gateways in Sanchi were constructed in 35 BC and they beautifully depict the different facets of Lord Buddha's life. The Eastern gateway shows the various stages of his journey, starting from his birth as a royal to his path of enlightenment.

The museum became open for public in 1966, when the museum was shifted. Its expanse is over 6.3 acres of land and houses a main hall and 4 galleries, consisting of artefacts and objects datable from the 3rd to the 12th century BC.

Amaravathi,"  Known as the Capital of Andhra Pradesh, Amaravathi is a planned city on the banks of the River Krishna. Amaravathi is renowned for being a site of a Buddhist Stupa that is a semi-hemispherical structure containing Buddhist relics and often called the Abode of God.  Located 32 kilometres north of Guntur District, Amaravati is a prime hub of pilgrimage and sightseeing. The original structure was established during the reign of Emperor Ashoka which is now a meditation site in the city. Being built on a 217km riverfront, the city is designed to have 51% of green spaces. Its foundation stone was laid on 22 October 2015 by prime Minister Narendra Modi. After the separation into two states in the year 2014, Hyderabad was declared the capital city of the then newly formed state Telangana. It led to Amaravathi being chosen as the Capital of Andhra Pradesh. The word Amaravathi in itself was derived from the ancient capital of Satavahana dynasty. Pilgrims visit this town almost throughout the year owing to the number of temples and shrines that adorn the little town in different parts. "," 1. Amareswara Temple, Amaravathi  :  As per Hindu legends, the Amareswara Temple is devoted to Lord Shiva, the 'Destroyer of the Universe'.  
 2. Amravati Museum, Amaravathi  :  This is a small but interesting museum in Amravati which displays exhibits that range between 3rd century BC and 12th century AD.  
 3. Dhyana Buddha Statue  :  Dhyana Buddha Statue is a hugeg statue of Buddha installed in Amaravathi in Andhra Pradesh. With a towering height of 125 ft, the statue is located on the banks of river Krishna. It has eight pillars resting on a Lotus pandal. The statue also has a museum beneath it which has scriptures on Buddhism and other relevant artefacts.  
 4. Amaravathi Mahachaitya  :  Amaravathi Mahachaitya is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Amaravathi. Constructed during the late Mauryan era, this ruined Buddhist monument was actually a Buddhist stupa, which housed the relics of great Buddhist scholars and thinkers.   
"," Amaravathi is well connected as a tourist hotspot only by road. Being the site of the new capital of Andhra Pradesh, the main connectivity is yet to come up. However, the nearest railway station and airports to this place are less than 60 kilometres away. Guntur railway station is barely 33.1 km from Amaravathi, while the nearest airport is in Gannavaram, Vijayawada, which is 58.9 km away from Amaravathi.
  "," Amaravathi is situated in Andhra Pradesh, and thus experiences a tropical climate, with mild winters. The best time for a visit to Amaravathi is in the winters, especially the months from October to March. The summers are unbearably hot, and the monsoons, although lovely and inviting, might dampen your plans if the rainfall is more than normal.
